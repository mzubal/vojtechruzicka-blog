## The concept
The concept of the book is simple. In a nutshell, each chapter is an interview with a well know developer advocate. After a brief introduction of the person, there is a series of questions. While some of the questions are specific to each person, many of them ten to repeat. Such as how did they become developer advocates, what advice would they give to people who want to become advocates themselves. How to deal with burnout and frequent travelling, technical problems or difficult questions.

## The advocates
The book contains interviews with 32 developer advocates in total. Here are some examples.

## Verdict
- TODO useful hints on how different people started
- TODO you get to know different interesting ppl from the community, even outside your regular circle
- TODO you can focus only on ppl you are interested in
- TODO same questions sometimes over and over, better to focus on ppls backgrounds and specific rather than over and over what is difference between advocate and evangelist, how they deal with technical glitches or difficult questions
- TODO would be great as audiobook or series of podcasts, it is quite long and repetetive
- TODO motivating for someone who wants to be more involved in the comunity, described how they became advocates and that you don't need to know everything and how to deal with difficult questions
