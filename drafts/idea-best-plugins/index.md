![IDEA best plugins](./idea-best-plugins.jpg)

## [Key promoter](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9792-key-promoter-x/)
Using keyboard shortcuts instead of your mouse can greatly increase your productivity. With so many features IDEA offers, it can be initimidating and difficult to learn all the shortcuts. Fortunately, there is a plugin called [Key Promoter](/learning-intellij-idea-keyboard-shortcuts/), which can help you. 

The idea is simple, whenever you use your mouse to invoke a command in your IDE, a popup is shown, which tells you what is the keyboard shortcut for this action.

![Key Promoter IntelliJ IDEA Plugin](./key-promoter.png)

It even offers you to assign a keyboard shortcut an action just performed if there is none yet. After a while it gets so annoying, so you rather make sure you remember your keyboard shortcuts.

## [Snyk](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10972-snyk-vulnerability-scanning/)
Application security is often unfortunately neglected. These days most of the application code comes from third party libraries and frameworks. You need to make sure you use new versions without security vulnerabilities. There are tools, which can help you with this, one of them is Snyk.

Snyk offers many features, one of them is [IDE plugin](/idea-snyk-plugin/), which can scan your dependencies and detect what security vulnerabilities they contain.

## [Presentation assistant](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7345-presentation-assistant/)
This is a simple plugin, which shows a pop-up notification every time you perform an action in IDEA. It shows what action was performed and what is the keyboard shortcut associated with it.

![Presentation Assistant](./presentation-assistant.png)

This can be very useful when [presenting](/intellij-idea-tips-tricks-presentations/), during screencasts, pair programming and so on. Especially when using keyboard shortcuts, it can be difficult to follow what's happening without this plugin.

## [Edu Tools](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10081-edutools/)
This is a great plugin for trainings, coding lessons, workshops and so on. It allows you to build courses, wth a set of taksks, which can be performed directly in your IDE. You can build your own courses, or import public courses.

This is available either as a searate plugin or as [IntelliJ IDEA Edu Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/education/download/#section=idea), which is basically IDEA Community edition with this plugin already bundled.

## [Extra icons](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/11058-extra-icons/)
This is basically an icon pack, which provides a new icon for special files such as travis configuration, package.json, lint config and many more.

This can be very useful as you can immediately recognize these special files and your project is therefore much easier to navigate. For example, `package.json` is a json file, but it is much more useful to have a special icon for it as it is an important file for npm projects.

# [Grazie](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12175-grazie/)
IntelliJ IDEA has a basic spelling checker, hwich allows you to detect some typos, but it is not much useful on top of that. It is definitely not a replacement for dedicated grammar checking services such as [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/).

Fortunately, there is a plugin called Grazie, which enhances the basic spell checker with a lot of useful features. It detects also more advanced issues, such as incorrect grammar. It works completely offline as well.

![Grazie IntelliJ IDEA plugin example](./grazie.png)

It allows you to enable checking of commit messages as well. You can lear more in the lbog post [Meet Grazie: the ultimate spelling, grammar, and style checker for IntelliJ IDEA](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2019/11/meet-grazie-the-ultimate-spelling-grammar-and-style-checker-for-intellij-idea/).

## [Maven Helper](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7179-maven-helper)
IDEA already has a powerful tools for [analyzing your dependencies](https://www.vojtechruzicka.com/idea-analyzing-dependencies) and potential problems with them such as conflicts or cyclic dependencies.

Maven helper offers an alternative UI, which shows your dependencies hierarchicaly. This can be easier to read and navigate. Also, if you're using the community edition, this is your only option.

![MAven Helper IntelliJ IDEA plugin](./maven-helper.png)

## [InnerBuilder](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7354-innerbuilder/)
Creating complex objects can be hard. Of course, you can stick with a simple POJO with a whole bunch of setters, but you cannot enforce that created object has all the required fields and is not used in incomplete state. To solve this you need constructors. With more comple objects, this can teald to a whole bunch of [telescopic constructors](https://www.vojtechruzicka.com/avoid-telescoping-constructor-pattern/) with many parameters. In these cases, using a builder is much more appropriate.

This plugin can automatically generate a builder for you from a POJO.

![InnerBuilder plugin for IntelliJ IDEA](./inner-builder-generator.png)

## [Rainbow Brackets](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10080-rainbow-brackets/)
If you are struggling with a lot of nested blocks and a lot of brackets, this plugin is for you. It makes it very easy to locate matching brackets as each pair of brackets is color coded.

![Rainbow Brackets IntelliJ IDEA Plugin](./rainbow-brackets.png)

It is quite hard to read with the default color theme, so Darcula is much more suitable for use with this plugin.

## [Indent Rainbow](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13308-indent-rainbow/)

This plugin is similar to Rainbow brackets, but it does not color your brackets, but rather your indentation. It can be beneficial if you have a lot of indentation levels, which are harder to navigate. It can even mark lines, which don't mark proper indentation levels with red, so it is immediately obvious when there is a mismatch.

![Indent Rainbow IntelliJ IDEA Plugin](./rainbow-indent.png)

Again, this is much less visible in the light theme, so Darcula may be a better choice. 

## [String Manipulation](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/2162-string-manipulation/)
This is a handy plugin, which allows you to perform variuos actions with your strings such as:
- Escaping/un-escaping for various contexts (Java, HTML, XML, SQL, ...)
- Case switching (lower, upper, kebab, pascal, camel, ...)
- Sorting
- Grep
- Trimming
