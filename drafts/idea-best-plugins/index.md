## Key promoter
Using keyboard shortcuts instead of your mouse can greatly increase your productivity. With so many features IDEA offers, it can be initimidating and difficult to learn all the shortcuts. Fortunately, there is a plugin called Key Promoter TODO link, which can help you. 

The idea is simple, whenever you use your mouse to invoke a command in your IDE, a popup is shown, which tells you what is the keyboard shortcut for this action.

After a while it gets so annoying, so you rather make sure you remember your keyboard shortcuts.

## Snyk

## Edu Tools
This is a great plugin for trainings, coding lessons, workshops and so on. It allows you to build courses, wth a set of taksks, which can be performed directly in your IDE. You can build your own courses, or import public courses.

TODO link rich

This is available either as a searate plugin or as IntelliJ IDEA Edu Edition, which is basically IDEA Community edition with this plugin already bundled.

## Extra icons
This is basically an icon pack, which provides a new icon for special files such as travis configuration, package.json, lint config and many more.

This can be very useful as you can immediately recognize these special files and your project is therefore much easier to navigate. For example, `package.json` is a json file, but is is much more useful to have a special icon for it as it is an important file for npm projects.
