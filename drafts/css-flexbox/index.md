![CSS Flexbox](css-flexbox.png)

## Flexbox
- flexible display module
- manage alignment
- distributing extra space
- When we describe flexbox as being one dimensional we are describing the fact that flexbox deals with layout in one dimension at a time â€” either as a row or as a column. This can be contrasted with the two-dimensional model of CSS Grid Layout, which controls columns and rows together.
- If I were to work in Arabic, then the start edge of my main axis would be on the right and the end edge on the left.
- flext container vs flex items
- specification: https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/


## Flex container

TODO flex (=flex block)
TODO flex-inline

### Flex direction
- default is row

### Wrapping

### Aligning content
- justify-content
- default flex-start
- flex-end, center, space-between, space-around

## Item level properties

### Aligning individual items

### Ordering items
Items in the flexbox container are not necessary displayed in the order, in which they are declared in HTML. That is, you can reorder items by assigning them specific `order` property. This is an integer value and defaults to 0 if not specified otherwise. This property is set not on the flex container level, but at the item level, as you want to order individual items.

If you want to put items before those, which don't have order specified, you can use negative values.

Multiple items can have the same `order` value. Such items belong to the same *ordinal group*. Items within the same group are then ordered in the same order in which they are declared in HTML.

For example, if you have three items with order 1, they will be placed after all the items with lower order. All these three items with the same order value will then be placed in the same order as in HTML.

### Visual, not logical order
You have to be careful when changing order in a flexbox container this way. This only changes visual order of the items, not logical order. In other words, in DOM, the items are still placed in the same order as in HTML. 

This has several implications. Most notably, any assistive technologies as screen readers will process the items in their original order. This also applies to keyboard navigation using <kbd>Tab</kbd> key, unless you also explicitly change `tab-order` of your components.

## Browser Support
Fortunately, flexbox currently has [great support](https://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox) across all the major browsers. That is 98.72% of all the users. It is even supported by IE 11, even though [it has many issues](https://github.com/philipwalton/flexbugs) and some non-standard behavior.
